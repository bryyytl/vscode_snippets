	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Typescript React Function Component": {
		"prefix": "rh",
		"body": [
		  "import React from 'react'",
		  "",
		  "interface ${TM_FILENAME_BASE}Props {",
		  "$1",
		  "}",
		  "",
		  "const $TM_FILENAME_BASE = ({} : ${TM_FILENAME_BASE}Props) => {",
		  "\t\treturn ($3);",
		  "}",
		  "",
		  "export default $TM_FILENAME_BASE;"
		],
		"description": "Typescript React Function Component"
	  },
}
